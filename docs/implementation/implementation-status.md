## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

Given the comprehensive scope, we'll implement in this order:

1. **Phase 3 Next Steps** (Highest Priority - Core Functionality)
   - Vacancy preparation implementation
   - ML service improvements (retry, caching)
   - Tests
   - Monitoring

2. **Phase 4-6 Next Steps** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement critical features
   - Add tests
   - Complete manual testing
   - Verify acceptance criteria
