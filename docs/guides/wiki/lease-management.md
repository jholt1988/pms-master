# Lease Management

The Lease Management feature allows property managers to view and manage leases, and tenants to view their own lease.

## Managing Leases (Property Managers)

To view and manage leases, navigate to the "Lease Management" page. You will see a list of all leases for your properties.

## Viewing Your Lease (Tenants)

To view your lease, navigate to the "My Lease" page. You will see the details of your lease, including the start and end dates, and the rent amount.
