# Tenant Screening

The Tenant Screening feature allows property managers to screen tenants who have applied for a rental property.

## Screening a Tenant (Property Managers)

To screen a tenant, navigate to the "Applications" page and click the "Screen" button for the application you want to screen. This will run a background check on the applicant and provide a recommendation on whether to rent to them.
