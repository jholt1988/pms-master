## Workflow 1: The Move-In Inspection Process

This workflow covers the entire move-in inspection process, from scheduling the inspection to the final tenant signature.

### For Property Managers: Scheduling and Conducting an Inspection

**1. Scheduling a Move-In Inspection**

When you create a new lease in the system, you will be prompted to schedule a move-in inspection.

*   **Step 1**: After creating a lease, the system will automatically suggest an inspection date, typically 2 days before the lease starts.
*   **Step 2**: Confirm the date. The inspection will be scheduled, and you and the tenant will receive an email notification.
*   **Step 3**: You can see the scheduled inspection on your main dashboard calendar.

    `[Screenshot: The calendar view on the dashboard showing the newly scheduled inspection]`

**2. Conducting the Digital Inspection**

On the day of the inspection, you can use a tablet or phone to conduct the inspection on-site.

*   **Step 1**: From your dashboard, navigate to the scheduled inspection.
*   **Step 2**: You will see a room-by-room checklist (e.g., Kitchen, Bathroom, Bedroom 1).
*   **Step 3**: For each item on the checklist, select its condition (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, Damaged).
*   **Step 4**: You can add notes and upload photos (up to 5 per item) for any item. This is highly recommended to document the property's condition.

    `[Screenshot: The inspection checklist view on a tablet, showing an item with condition selection, notes, and a photo upload button]`

*   **Step 5**: If an item needs repair, check the "Requires Action" box.
*   **Step 6**: Your progress is saved automatically. If you get interrupted, you can always come back and continue where you left off.
*   **Step 7**: Once you have gone through all the rooms, you can complete the inspection, which will then notify the tenant to review and sign it.

### For Tenants: Reviewing and Signing the Inspection

**1. Receiving and Reviewing the Inspection**

*   **Step 1**: You will receive an email with a secure link to review the completed move-in inspection report.
*   **Step 2**: Click the link to open the report. You will see a read-only view of the checklist, including all the property manager's notes and photos.

    `[Screenshot: The tenant's view of the completed inspection report, showing rooms, items, conditions, and photos]`

**2. Digitally Signing the Report**

*   **Step 1**: At the bottom of the report, you will find a signature section.
*   **Step 2**: Use your mouse or finger (on a touch screen) to draw your signature in the signature box. You can clear and re-draw it if you are not satisfied.
*   **Step 3**: Once you are happy with your signature, click "Submit".
*   **Step 4**: After submitting, you will receive a confirmation email with a PDF copy of the signed inspection report for your records. The inspection is now locked and cannot be edited.

## Workflow 2: AI-Powered Repair Estimation (For Property Managers)

This workflow explains how to use the AI-powered feature to generate repair cost estimates from a completed inspection.

**1. Generating a Repair Estimate**

*   **Step 1**: Open a completed inspection report that has items marked as "Requires Action".
*   **Step 2**: Click the "Generate Estimate" button.
*   **Step 3**: A progress indicator will appear, showing the AI's 6-step analysis process. This should take less than 30 seconds.

    `[Screenshot: The progress indicator for the AI estimate generation]`

*   **Step 4**: Once complete, you will see a summary of the estimate, including total cost, labor, and material breakdown.

**2. Reviewing and Approving the Estimate**

*   **Step 1**: You can expand each line item to see details, including a "Repair vs. Replace" recommendation and the reasoning behind it.
*   **Step 2**: If you need to make adjustments, you can manually override the AI-generated costs.
*   **Step 3**: Once you are satisfied with the estimate, click "Approve". This will lock in the costs.

**3. Converting an Estimate to Work Orders**

*   **Step 1**: On an approved estimate, a "Create Work Orders" button will appear.
*   **Step 2**: Clicking this button will automatically group the repair items by category (e.g., Plumbing, Electrical) and create a separate maintenance request for each.
*   **Step 3**: These maintenance requests will be sent to the appropriate technicians with all the necessary details, including the estimated costs and photos from the inspection.

## Workflow 3: The Move-Out Inspection and Deposit Handling (For Property Managers)

This workflow covers the move-out process, from comparing inspections to calculating security deposit deductions.

**1. Comparing Move-In and Move-Out Inspections**

*   **Step 1**: After conducting a move-out inspection, you can open it and use the "Compare with Move-In" feature.
*   **Step 2**: This will show you a side-by-side view of the move-in and move-out inspections for the same unit.

    `[Screenshot: The split-screen comparison view, showing before and after photos and highlighted condition changes]`

*   **Step 3**: The system will highlight any changes in condition and help you distinguish between normal wear and tear and tenant-caused damage.

**2. Calculating Security Deposit Deductions**

*   **Step 1**: From the move-out inspection, generate a repair estimate for any damages.
*   **Step 2**: The system will help you calculate the appropriate deduction by considering the item's age, depreciation, and tenant responsibility.
*   **Step 3**: Once the deductions are calculated, you can generate an itemized deduction letter to be sent to the tenant. This letter will include a breakdown of the charges and the supporting photos.

## Workflow 4: Routine Maintenance Inspections (For Property Managers)

This workflow explains how to manage routine and annual inspections to stay on top of preventive maintenance.

**1. Scheduling Routine Inspections**

*   You can schedule `ROUTINE` or `ANNUAL` inspections that are not tied to a specific lease. This is useful for proactive maintenance.
*   You can assign an inspector and set a date, and the inspector will be notified.

**2. Preventive Maintenance**

*   Your dashboard has a widget that shows items from all properties that are approaching their expected end-of-life or are in poor condition.
*   From this widget, you can directly create a maintenance request to replace an item before it fails.

## Workflow 5: The Technician Experience

This section is for maintenance technicians.

**1. Viewing a Work Order**

*   When you are assigned a work order generated from an inspection, you will receive a notification.
*   Opening the work order will show you all the details you need:
    *   A list of tasks.
    *   Estimated labor hours and material costs.
    *   Repair instructions.
    *   Photos of the issue from the inspection.

    `[Screenshot: The technician's view of a work order with all its details]`

**2. Recording Actual Costs**

*   After you complete the work, you can enter the actual hours you spent and the actual cost of materials.
*   This information is used to track the accuracy of the AI estimates and improve them over time.

## Workflow 6: Tenant Self-Service

This section is for tenants.

**1. Viewing Your Inspection History**

*   From your tenant dashboard, you can access a page with your entire inspection history for your unit.
*   You can view any past inspection report and download the PDF copy.

    `[Screenshot: The tenant's inspection history page]`

**2. Disputing a Deposit Deduction**

*   If you disagree with a deduction from your security deposit, you can initiate a dispute.
*   You will be able to view the itemized deduction letter, add comments to specific items, and upload your own photos as evidence.
*   Once you submit a dispute, the property manager will be notified, and you can track the status of your dispute in the app.

## Workflow 7: Reporting and Analytics (For Property Owners and Managers)

This workflow explains the reporting features available in the application.

**1. Inspection Summary Reports**

*   You can generate reports that show aggregate data from inspections across your properties.
*   These reports include metrics like average property condition, most common issues, and total repair costs.
*   The data is visualized in charts to help you spot trends over time.

    `[Screenshot: The reporting dashboard with charts and key metrics]`

**2. Estimate Accuracy Dashboard**

*   This dashboard shows how accurate the AI-powered estimates are compared to the actual costs recorded by technicians.
*   This helps you understand the reliability of the estimates and provides insights into areas where costs are consistently over or underestimated.
