## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: More specific questions get better answers
2. **Use Commands**: Commands execute actions automatically
3. **Check Suggestions**: Click suggested action buttons for quick navigation
4. **Voice Input**: Use voice for hands-free interaction (supported browsers)
5. **Session Context**: The AI remembers your conversation within a session

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The AI doesn't understand my question**
- Try rephrasing or being more specific
- Use the quick action buttons for common tasks

**Q: Voice input doesn't work**
- Make sure you're using Chrome, Edge, or Safari
- Grant microphone permission in browser settings

**Q: Commands don't execute**
- Check that the command matches supported patterns
- Verify you have permission for the action

**Q: Responses seem generic**
- Provide more context in your question
- The system learns from your conversation history
